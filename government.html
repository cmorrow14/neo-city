<h1>NeoCity Government Q&amp;A</h1><p style="font-style: italic; color: #ccc; max-width: 700px; margin: 1rem auto; text-align: center;">This page is designed for government officials, policy advisors, and civic planners seeking to understand NeoCity’s local impact and long-term structure.</p>
<div class="qa"><strong>Q1: How does this project actually help the local economy?</strong><p>Tourism might be the spark, but the deeper value stays local. Every visitor supports jobs, housing operators, small vendors, and public infrastructure. This isn’t a tourist trap — it’s a civic engine designed to keep the money circulating inside the community.</p></div>
<div class="qa"><strong>Q2: Is the land going to be sold to private companies or outsiders?</strong><p>No. The land remains public — always. NeoCity Vision Studio only requests a long-term ground lease (such as 99 years) so we can invest and build responsibly without owning the land. This ensures local control and prevents land speculation or foreign buyouts.</p></div>
<div class="qa"><strong>Q3: What does the government get in return — and when?</strong><p>Benefits begin immediately: lease payments, job creation, and shared revenue from tourism and services. As the city grows, the government gains visibility, investment interest, and a globally respected showcase of sovereign development.</p></div>
<div class="qa"><strong>Q4: What happens if the project fails or doesn’t scale?</strong><p>Even in a worst-case scenario, what’s left behind is valuable: clean water, housing, infrastructure, markets. There is no public debt and no “ghost city.” The core systems are usable no matter what — and fully owned by the people.</p></div>
<div class="qa"><strong>Q5: Will this project respect local religion, culture, and values?</strong><p>Completely. The city is designed from the inside out with Zanzibar in mind. That includes prayer spaces, gender-aware planning, halal food markets, and a local Justice &amp; Culture Council that helps guide decisions from day one.</p></div>
<div class="qa"><strong>Q6: Why should we believe this can work?</strong><p>You shouldn’t have to believe. You should see it. That’s why we’re starting with a small, walkable prototype — one square mile. One real place. We’re not asking for blind faith — we’re asking for the chance to prove what’s possible.</p></div>
<div class="qa"><strong>Q7: Will this grow into another megacity?</strong><p>No. Growth is based on need and demand, not ego. This isn’t about building tall or fast — it’s about building right. Every phase is timed to local readiness and capacity. We don’t want a giant city. We want a great one.</p></div>
<div class="qa"><strong>Q8: How will safety be handled?</strong><p>Through smart design and local trust. Well-lit walkways, open layouts, community patrols, and partnerships with local law enforcement — not private guards or fences. Safety comes from community connection, not control.</p></div>
<div class="qa"><strong>Q9: What kind of legal structure will oversee all this?</strong><p>Everything flows through a public trust, co-governed with local stakeholders. All contracts, partnerships, and utilities are transparent and trackable. NeoCity doesn’t own the city — we help build and steward it.</p></div>
<div class="qa"><strong>Q10: Why us? Why now?</strong><p>Because Zanzibar still has a window of flexibility — and the world is watching. This project isn’t about outsiders taking control. It’s about building something with the government that benefits the people. If we don’t do it right now, someone else will do it wrong.</p></div>
