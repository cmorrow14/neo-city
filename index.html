    <h1>Building the Cities That Belong to Their People</h1>
    <p>Kisiwa Mpya is a walkable, culturally rooted prototype city â€” starting in Zanzibar, designed for locals, and ready to inspire the world.</p>

    <section id="about">
        <p>NeoCity Vision Studio helps governments and communities co-create future-ready cities â€” ones that protect cultural identity, ensure public control of land, and invite the world without selling it off. Our pilot project, Kisiwa Mpya, is a 1-square-mile prototype in Zanzibar that shows how tourism, equity, and walkability can thrive together. We build with intention, not speculation.</p>

        <p>This is our prototype for whatâ€™s possible elsewhere.</p>
        <p>And in doing so, we help Zanzibar become a symbol â€” not of exploitation, but of visionary, sovereign development.</p>
