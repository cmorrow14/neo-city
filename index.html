    <h2>About NeoCity Vision Studio</h2>
    <p>NeoCity Vision Studio helps governments and communities co-create future-ready cities — ones that protect cultural identity, ensure public control of land, and invite the world without selling it off. Our pilot project, Kisiwa Mpya, is a 1-square-mile prototype in Zanzibar that shows how tourism, equity, and walkability can thrive together. We build with intention, not speculation.</p>

    <h2>What Does “Kisiwa Mpya” Mean?</h2>
    <p>“Kisiwa Mpya” is Swahili for “New Island.” It reflects the spirit of renewal — not by erasing the past, but by building on it. This name honors Zanzibar’s island identity while offering a bold symbol for what a better future can look like when shaped locally.</p>

    <h2>Why Zanzibar</h2>
    <p>This is our prototype for what’s possible elsewhere.</p>
    <p>And in doing so, we help Zanzibar become a symbol — not of exploitation, but of visionary, sovereign development.</p>
